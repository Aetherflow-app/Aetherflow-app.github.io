## Authentication Assets
The authentication system has been implemented in the pricing.html page using Firebase Authentication.
Key features:
- Email/password login and registration
- Google OAuth authentication
- Password reset functionality
- Seamless login from extension with token passing
- Auth status synchronization between website and extension

The auth UI is designed to be non-intrusive and match the existing website design, with login controls in the navigation bar and a modal dialog for authentication forms.
